# Offchain Labs 

![Offcain Labs](/assets/images/offchain_logo.png)


Offchain Labs, Inc. is a Princeton, NJ company building a Layer 2 platform to unlock the full potential of smart contracts, making them private, affordable, and easy for developers. Our working prototype of Arbitrum runs on top of Ethereum and interoperates with native Ethereum contracts and tokens. We make smart contracts easier to develop at scale, with production level security. Our developer tools do the heavy lifting to add a flexible second layer to decentralized application architecture so our clients can focus on business logic and user experience.
