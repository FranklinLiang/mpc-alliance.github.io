# Security model

Before diving into MPC protocol, we should define the security goal, which is called the security model in cryptography. The semi-honest model and malicious model are widely considered to capture the capabilities of adversaries. Many specific techniques are proposed to construct semi-honest or malicious MPC protocols, such as garbled circuit, secret sharing, oblivious transfer, homomorphic encryption and their combinations.
