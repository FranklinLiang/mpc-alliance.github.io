[AMIS](https://www.am.is/) is a blockchain startup company founded in 2016 in Taiwan and offers scalable blockchain infrastructure services and threshold signing for wallet service. Speaking of key protection, AMIS provides a MPC-based solution called [hierarchical threshold signature scheme](https://github.com/getamis/alice/).

In Taiwan, AMIS cooperates with two local banks Fubon and Taishin to run a sandbox experiment, which is granted by the Financial Supervisory Commission, for blockchain payment system.

AMIS also participates in many open source projects. In 2017, AMIS collaborated with JP Morgan and introduced the first implementation of [Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerance (IBFT)](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/650) to Quorum.

AMIS open sourced [indexer](https://github.com/getamis/eth-indexer), which is used to index chain data efficiently like Etherscan, and [Vishwakarma](https://github.com/getamis/vishwakarma), a DevOps tool for deploying Kubernetes cluster for blockchain node managements.
